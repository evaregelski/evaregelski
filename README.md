# Pastina Dress Up Game! 


This is my first JavaScript project ever! I wanted to make a simple and cute dress up game based on my Shih Tzu, Pastina. I created all of the pixel art myself in the Procreate app on my iPad.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Procreate (for the art)

I don't really know what to write here other than the fact that it took me a great number of google searches and tweaking things by 1 pixel at a time to get things to look the way I wanted. Who knew!

## What's to Come:
- More outfit options, for sure!
- A better way to choose outfit options perhaps. This would help with scalability as the options continue to grow.

## Lessons Learned:
Literally everything. This is my first time touching any of these languages :0 I didn't anticipate for CSS to give me the most trouble considering I'm a UX/UI designer, but here_we_are.
